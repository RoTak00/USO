Write a function "int eof(int d) that tests if the current position in the file with descriptor "d" is at the end of the file, using "lseek()" and "stat()". The function returns 1 (yes), 0 (no) or -1 (error). 

Use this function in a demonstrative program that copies standard input to standard output (until eof)
